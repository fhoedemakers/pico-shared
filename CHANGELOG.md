# Release notes

## 22/12/2024

- The menu now uses the entire screen resolution of 320x240 pixels. This makes a 40x30 char screen with 8x8 font possible instead of 32x29. This also fixes the menu not displaying correctly on Risc-v builds because of not implemented assembly renedering routine in Risc-v.
- Updated NESPAD to have CLK idle HIGH instead of idle LOW. Thanks to [ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud). 
- Other minor changes.
