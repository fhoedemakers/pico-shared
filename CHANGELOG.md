# Release notes

## 22/12/2024

- Use the entire screen resolution of 320x240 pixels for the menu. This makes a 40x30 screen with 8x8 font possible. This also fixes the menu not displaying correctly on Risc-v builds because of not implemented assembly renedering routine in Risc-v.
- Updated NESPAD to have CLK idle HIGH instead of idle LOW. Thanks to [ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud).
